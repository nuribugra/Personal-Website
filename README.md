# Personal Website (Responsive)

Before the intermediate Javascript lessons, I want to create a personal website for myself. 

Project Details:
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Variables
- Basic Javascript
- Rem Units
- Responsive Design

### PS: I prefer minimalism in everything. That's why I designed this website from a minimalist perspective. In my opinion, the website is in perfect condition in terms of accessibility and aesthetics.
